# Quadratic-Formula

Greetings!!

This project was built during my free time while commuting for fun. The code for this project only runs on Python. 

The project involves a calculator which determines the roots of any quadratic given particular and arbitrary values for a, b, and c 
using the quadratic formula. This calculator is capable of calculating any roots egardless of being real or imaginary.

The purpose of this project is to provide others with a simple and elegant root calculator without requiring any wifi.
